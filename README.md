## ✍️ Reflection
> Building this portfolio website with AI support (Copilot/ChatGPT) gave me a “quick win” and confidence to ship live code.  
> As projects increase in complexity, my understanding of fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS, GitHub workflow) will guide my ability to iterate and scale effectively.
