## ✍️ Reflection

### Building Websites with AI  
Building this portfolio website with AI support (Copilot/ChatGPT) gave me a *quick win* and confidence to ship live code.  
As projects increase in complexity, my understanding of fundamentals (**HTML, CSS, JS, GitHub workflow**) will guide my ability to iterate and scale effectively.  

### Interview Question  
**Q:** Tell me about a website project you’ve built.  
**A:** I built a personal portfolio site using semantic HTML and modern CSS, deployed live on GitHub Pages. It showcases my projects, skills, and workflow. This project sharpened my ability to structure clean code, manage a Git workflow, and design with accessibility in mind.  

### LinkedIn Post  
Excited to share that I’ve published my personal portfolio website! 🎉

This project highlights my growth in web development through **semantic HTML, modern CSS, GitHub Pages deployment, and responsive design**.  
I’m continuing to expand it with projects like **Stablemate®, Soundboard, and YourDrink** — secure, scalable ecosystems that reflect my vision as a builder.
